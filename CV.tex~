2015 - 2016, University of Bordeaux, France

\begin{itemize}
\item Master Research thesis supervised by Christophe Negre and Thomas Plantard : \textit{Randomization in RNS and Leak Resistant Arithmetic} \\
  \underline{Abstract :} The Leak Resistant Arithmetic proposed to randomize an exponentiation procedure in RNS via Montgomery’s multiplication. We study a modification of this approach by not clearing the mask during the procedure in order to save two Montgomery’s multiplications at each loop and improve the level of randomization.

\item Teaching followed : Programming (C), Arithmetic, Complexity Theory, Information Theory, Elliptic Curves (use of Pari/GP), Cryptology, Algorithmic Calculus (use of SageMaths), Introduction to Diophantine Approximations
\end{itemize}

\CVItem{Master Degree in Pure Mathematics}

2015, University of Bordeaux, France

\begin{itemize}
\item Master Thesis supervised by Pierre Parent : \textit{Th\'{e}or\`{e}me de Chabauty et version effective de Coleman} \\
  \underline{Abstract :} Faltings proved in 1983 that every curve of genus strictly greater than 1 has only a finite number of rational points. Sadly, his proof cannot be made efficient. But Coleman improved the intermediate result of Chabauty (40’s), which use some p-adic argument, to obtain a good bound for the number of rational points in special cases.

\item Teaching followed : Algebraic Geometry, Introduction to p-adic numbers, Computational Number Theory (use of Pari/GP), Group cohomology, Geometry

  \normalsize\normalfont
  \underline{Abstract :} We study siteswaps, which can be defined as one way to juggle and can be described mathematically. In particular, we use 
  different representations of these objects and study them from a combinatorial point of view.
